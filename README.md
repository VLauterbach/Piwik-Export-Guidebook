Navigating AML Piwik-Export
======

This guidebook is to be used to assist with any developers that are working on the [OZONE Platform Piwik-Export](https://github.com/aml-development/piwik-export). The guidebook will provide walkthroughs of a setup environment, how to add onto environment, and provide further explaination to the entirety of the metrics workspace being used by the AML project.

It is advisory to look at the [Developer Metrics Setup](https://github.com/aml-development/ozp-documentation/wiki/Developer_Metrics_Setup) page in the ozp-documentation wiki if one has not done so. At minimum, a local metrics environment is required in order to perform development on Piwik-Export. 

After reading this guidebook, it will be advisable to read further documentation on specifically the staging environment.
